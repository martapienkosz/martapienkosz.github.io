# ASSIGNMENT 1: 30MFF WEB SITE

## Project Description
<b>What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?</b>

The concept of my website was to build a scroll bar containing all the content: actors, information, contact. I strived for consistent aesthetics and orderly content. I chose to use white text blocks on a dark background to introduce order and regularity. I wanted my website to represent the idea behind 30 MMF: simple and playfull.

## Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.


## Reflection and Evaluation
<b>Were the expectations and goals  met in the process of building the final working version?</b>

My initial idea was to put a full-screen video and navigation over it. After reflection, I realized that the site does not speak for itself as it is not clear what the MFF 30 is. I decided to divide the space into two parts and have a short description and a video on the right.

Personally, I really like the layout of the blocks and the general appearance of the site. Initially, I wanted the background-image not to be fixed, but only to be the background for the initial divs. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to enter text above the image without using the absolute position.
