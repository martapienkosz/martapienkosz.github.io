# ASSIGNMENT 1: 30MFF WEB SITE

## Project Description
<b>What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?</b>

For the Assignment 1 for the Communication Lab course I have designed a website to host a short movie. In addition to eddited and completed in 30min video, the website contains the "about" section, short bio of the artists and contact us section. I strived for good user experience and minimalistic aesthetic. For this purpose I chose a consistent layout and decided to display blocks of text on white background. I believe this increases the readability of the website and introduces an appealing style. I wanted the webiste to represent the idea begind 30 MFF: playfull and simplistic.

## Process
<b>How did you go about implementing the concept</b>

I started building my website early on and had to remodify it twice. At first I didin't find the design with full size video suitable. I wanted to use smaller blocks of text that would be accmpanied by pictures. For this, I created four main containers corresponding to the sections in the navigation bar. At the beginning I started writing HTML and I was constantly adding text in CSS. At the very end I modifed the java script and added interactivity to my page. I decided on the appearing block of text with the names of the actors when the user hovers the mouse over the picture.

## Reflection and Evaluation
<b>Were the expectations and goals  met in the process of building the final working version?</b>

My initial idea was to put a full-screen video and navigation over it. After the implementation, I realized that the site does not speak for itself as it is not clear what the 30 MMF is about. I decided to divide a home page into two parts and have a short description on left and a video on the right. Personally, I really like the layout of the blocks and the general appearance of the site. Initially, I wanted the background-image not to be fixed, but only to be the background for the initial divs. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to enter text above the image without using the absolute position.
