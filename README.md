# ASSIGNMENT 1: 30MFF WEB SITE

## Project Description
<b>What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?</b>

For the Assignment 1 for the Communication Lab course I have designed a website to host a short movie. In addition to eddited and completed in 30min video, the website contains the "about" section, short bio of the artists and contact us section. I strived for good user experience and minimalistic aesthetic. For this purpose I chose a consistent layout and decided to display blocks of text on white background. I believe this increases the readability of the website and introduces an appealing style. I wanted the webiste to represent the idea begind 30 MFF: playfull and simplistic.

## Process
<b>How did you go about implementing the concept</b>

I started building my website with wireframing. In [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6dd68400-987b-4a94-8cd6-f28783bf6d1e-3885/) I have created a prototype and chose suitable colors for my website. Nextly I stared implementing  full-screen video and navigation over it both in HTML and CSS. Soon after I realized that the site does not speak for itself as it is not clear what the 30 MMF is about. I decided to divide the home page into two parts and have a short description on left and a video on the right. This way viewer has direct access to short info about the website and can play the video.

I divided content into four sections and created specific containers for each. In each of those I inserted several diva displayed in 'flex' mode. This allowed me to create desired spaces between elements and justtify content. I believe it also made my code more readable and provided some degree of responsiveness to my project.

In the final stage I have modified java script and added interactivity to my website. I chose to set a mouseover function so that the text with actor name is being displayed when the user hovers the mouse over the picture.

## Reflection and Evaluation
<b>Were the expectations and goals met in the process of building the final working version?</b>

I believe that the expectations and goals were met in my final version. The website appears to be user-friendly and has an element of interactivity. In addition, white text blocks give this site a unique character that visually corresponds to the shots. I found the project to be coherent and the overall message of the 30th IFF was conveyed.

Initially, I wanted the background image not to be pernament, but only serve as a background for the home page. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to insert text over an image without using absolute position.

Besides, I might have thought about including interactivity earlier. I believe that if I were to consider interactivity in the early planning phase, it could work better and be more attractive. There was very limited space to enable some interactivity once the overall content was built.
